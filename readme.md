# Gullible Toy

Welcome to **Gullible Toy**, a fun interactive tool that allows you to modify shapes and page elements on the fly using simple commands! ðŸŽ®

This tool lets you use CSS-like commands to modify the shape's properties and the background of the page. It's designed to be simple for beginners but flexible enough for anyone who wants to experiment with their web page.

## Features

- Modify shapes (size, color, text, and more) using simple commands.
- Change the bg color of the page with ease.
- Drag the shape around the screen to place it wherever you like.
- Pre-set commands (generated by ChatGPT) for beginners under the "I'm a noob" button.
- A reset feature for both the shape and the entire page.
- Live Demo on [https://sayhan1610.github.io/](https://sayhan1610.github.io/)

## Files

1. **index.html** - The main page that contains the shape and input controls for commands
2. **instructions.html** - A page that provides instructions on how to use the tool.
3. **styles.css** - The styles for the website and shape.
4. **script.js** - The JavaScript that handles the logic behind executing commands and dragging the shape.
5. **commands.json** - A JSON file that contains predefined commands for the "I'm a noob" dropdown list. (This was majorly generated using GPT to save time and may not work as intended)

## How it works

To use **Gullible Toy**, you just ened to enter a caommand in the input box and press **Execute**. The commands work in the following format:

```
TYPE;PROPERTY=VALUE
```

Where:

- **TYPE** can be `shape`, `background`, or `page`.
- **PROPERTY** is any valid CSS property (e.g., `background-color`, `border-radius`, etc)
- **VALUE** is the value you want to apply to that property (e.g., `red`, `50px`, etc).

### Example Commands

- `shape;background-color=blue` â€“ Changes the shapeâ€™s background to blue.
- `shape;border-radius=50%` â€“ Turns the shape into a circle.
- `background;background-color=lightgray` â€“ Changes the pageâ€™s background color.
- `shape;sides=5` â€“ Turns the shape into a pentagon.

### Special Commands

- `shape;reset` â€“ Resets only the shape to its default state.
- `page;reset` â€“ Resets everything on the page to its default state.

## Drag the Shape

You can also **drag the shape** around the page by clicking and holding it. It will follow your mouse/touch movements and can eb placed anywhere on the screen.

## Caution

Be carefule when using commands like `shape;sides-1000` as it could cause performance issues and/or crash your browser! Stick to more reasonable values to keep the fun rolling without crashing the page. ðŸ˜œ
