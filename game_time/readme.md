# Game Time

Yo, welcome to **Game Time**! 🎮 This whole thing started as a surprise for my girlfriend’s birthday (because I’m just that cool), but like, honestly, it’s not just for that. You can use it for pretty much any occasion—birthdays, random fun, or just to kill time when you’re bored. It’s like a mini-game collection, hence the name **Game Time** (real original, I know).

Look, I’m gonna be straight with you—it's not the most secure thing in the world, and it’s _very_ hackable (every single page, don't even try). But hey, most people won’t bother messing with it, so I wouldn't worry about it. Just come for the fun, alright?

Anyway, hope you enjoy this! It’s here for good vibes, not stress.

## About

So here’s the deal: **Game Time** is just a little collection of games I made, originally for my girlfriend’s birthday, but it works for anyone.

It’s hosted on my personal GitHub page, so you just click the link and you’re good to go. No sign-ins, no hoops to jump through, just pure fun.

### Why I Made This

Look, I made this thing to surprise mi novia on her birthday, but then I realized—this is actually pretty chill. So why not make it public? It's not perfect, but it’s fun and weird enough to entertain you for a bit. Plus, I was bored. 😆

## Security Disclaimer

Alright, let’s get real for a sec—**Game Time** is **not** secure. It’s wide open for hacking (I’m not even joking). Every page and feature is hackable if you know what you’re doing. But honestly, who’s gonna bother? It’s just a bunch of silly games. So yeah, no sensitive stuff here, and don’t go looking for a way to break into it.
