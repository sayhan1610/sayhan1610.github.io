# Find me Santa

`Santa` and [`HackClub winter Boba`](https://ahoy.hack.club/1867) welcomes you to **[Find Me Santa](https://sayhan1610.github.io/findmesanta/)**, an interactive Christmas themed experience where you can connect to Santa's terminal and receiv exclusive delivery information ~~(your IP and user agent infor)~~. This web app is for you to access your IP information anytime but with a holiday experience in the side dish.

## Features:

- **Connection to Santa's Terminal:** A fund, interactive popup simulates a connection to Santa's terminal, to basically just log your IP, location, and device details _temporarily_.

- **Flying Santa:** Santa will fly across the screen. ~~rare occasion though~~
- **Terminal Interface:** Enjoy Christmasthemed music and Santa's ~~terrifying~~ voice.

## How it works:

1. **User Consent**: Upon landing the page, a model window will ask for your permission to access some of your device IP information.
2. **IP Information**: Terminal displays your IP address, location, browser and OS infos
3. **Christmas Fun**: Throughout the experience, you'll hear joyful Christmas music and watch a playful snowfall effect

## Instructions:

1. **Accept Connection**: Click the **Hohoho** button to allow Santa's terminal connection and enjoy the magic of Christmas.
2. **Decline Connection**: If you don't wish to connect, click the **Nonono** button, and you'll still get a cheerful holiday message from Santa's elves. ~~why tf wouldn't you tho?~~
